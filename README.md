# JavaScript
This is a collection of simple JS projects I've worked on. Since these are all smaller use cases, I thought it would make more sense to club them under one repository. 

<br />

If you want to know more of what to expect from this codebase, here is a quick description of the projects and a screenshot showing how they look. ðŸ˜„

+ **Calculator** - A simple calculator implemented with vanilla JS.
